Still reeling from last weekend. Of course, I’m filled with joy and the honor of being part of the grand event that was the [All Worlds Fair](https://allworldsfair.com). But then there also was Sunday the 24th…

12am — Cheers erupt from all the artists as the last AWF show ends for the downstairs vault level of the Mint

1am — Upstairs show is finished with exhausted happy smiles

2am — Wonderful little surprise after-party

6am — drive my girlfriend Tess Aquarium to the airport and wish her goodbye for a month, then drive back to catch a couple hours of sleep

11am — arrive at the Mint for breakdown and watch with heavy heart as all the creative magic disappears

5pm — hop in the truck cab with Chicken John and Joseph Hren to help manage delivering all the wonderfully ridiculous art back to its creators

12am — in bed which was very noticeably absent my favorite mermaid.

Such a bittersweet day. It’s been an overwhelmingly wonderfully intense several months on several levels, and it all came grinding to a halt with such fierce momentum. Heavy, but a heaviness I will cherish as it’s seldom that life gifts such amazing contrasting emotions all in one 24hr period. Also, I walk forward knowing this yielding is only temporary. Tess will be back before I know it and the Art… well you know I can’t stop making Art happen.

\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an addendum… one of my favorite moments from the All Worlds Fair was when someone accidentally spilled black &amp; white paint right by the entrance, 15min before opening of the first show. Me rushing to help clean it up while wearing my white tuxedo. Chicken walking up saying “You got to be fucking kidding me!” And then once it was cleaned, out of nowhere the Emperor Norton himself stepped up and cleaned the paint off my shoes. You couldn’t create a more ridiculous catastrophe better if you planned it. Seriously that was Art.
