![Newsom vs Chicken in the Matrix](https://catcubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/newsom_and-chicken-matrix.jpg)  
Chicken John, SF Mayoral Candidate, has started a blog: [Chicken John Rinaldi For Mayor of San Francisco](https://voteforchicken.com/), which includes an instructional video to help collect signatures. He needs to collect 10,000 signatures by Wednesday, July 25th to get on the ballot — [go help him out](https://voteforchicken.com/2007/07/19/video-help-chicken-john-run-for-mayor-of-san-francisco/)!

Chicken’s joined facebook too on the advice of [Scott Beale](https://laughingsquid.com/scott-beale/) of [LaughingSquid](https://laughingsquid.com/). Chicken’s also on that den of iniquity and bad design [myspace](https://www.myspace.com/chickenjohn) and [tribe](https://people.tribe.net/a1d78646-efee-4e5f-80ca-3a11d409d9d2?_click_path=Application%5Btribe%5D.Person%5Ba1d78646-efee-4e5f-80ca-3a11d409d9d2%5D). Next thing we know he’ll be on Twitter, Flickr, Pownce, Digg, Delicious, and of course YouTube — well actually Chicken is already on YouTube with a video of him [eating a lightbulb](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4TmnZzyWaxw).

So let’s tally up the scores of who’s the more 21st Century political candidate…

### Google Name Recognition

- **Gavin Newsom** – [698,000 search results](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22gavin+newsom%22&btnG=Search) and an [extensive wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom)
- **Chicken John** – [78,300 search results](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22chicken+john%22&btnG=Search) and a [pitifully small stub of a wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_john)

### Web 2.0 Social Aptitude

- **Chicken John** – 1 facebook profile, 1 [myspace profile](https://www.myspace.com/chickenjohn), 1 [tribe profile](https://people.tribe.net/a1d78646-efee-4e5f-80ca-3a11d409d9d2?_click_path=Application%5Btribe%5D.Person%5Ba1d78646-efee-4e5f-80ca-3a11d409d9d2%5D)
- **Gavin Newsom** – 3 facebook profiles, 3 myspace profiles, and one [Gavin Newsom Sucks](https://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=70429663) myspace profile. {*While Gavin wins by sheer number of profiles I have a strange feeling they aren’t really him, so I had to give this one to Chicken*}

### Blog-o-sphere Cred

- **Chicken John** – 1 fresh off the presses [mayoral blog](https://voteforchicken.com/) written by the man himself (when he doesn’t have the cold that is); hosted at WordPress.com but with his own domain which adds a couple more cred points
- **Gavin Newsom** – 1 [boring PR spewing pseudo-blog](https://sfmayor.typepad.com/) written by the mayoral toadies in Newsom’s name; hosted as a subdomain on Typepad. And 1 [other boring PR spewing pseudo-blog](https://www.actlocallysf.org/index.php) with an unknown CMS with a lousy old HTML 4.01 Transitional doctype.

### YouTube Stardom

- **Chicken John** – Aforementioned [Chicken John eating a lightbulb](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4TmnZzyWaxw) and [Chicken John Bus Trip to Locke, CA](https://youtube.com/watch?v=DuWAXJQRrrk) ( Footage of the Chicken John Bus Trip to Locke. With footage of Dammit the Wonder Dog)
- **Gavin Newsom** – [Gavin’s meltdown](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZUb8Xv6m7lU) and [Gavin Newsom &amp; the Man Code](https://youtube.com/watch?v=S3E-7JcS1Jc) (reflect on Gavin Newsom’s betrayal of a good friend.)

*From a mayoral gravitas perspective, I don’t think either candidate wins in this department.*

So there you have it! **Chicken John is the better 21st century political candidate!** Gavin is more searchable by far, but Chicken’s web presence is more personal and web 2.0 connected — quantity vs quality.

Unfortunately, for elections it’s quantity that wins. No matter though it’s always worth it to add that little something else to spice up the pot, so go [help Chicken John by signing to get him on the ballot](https://voteforchicken.com/2007/07/19/video-help-chicken-john-run-for-mayor-of-san-francisco/)!
