![Self Portrait Artists, Bruce Nauman, Chuck Close, Robert Arneson, and Jack Black](https://catcubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/selfportraits.jpg)*Casting an eye on one’s self* has been the subject of many an artist’s works. Most artists have a range of subject matter but for some, such as painter [Chuck Close](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibitions/exhib_detail.asp?id=208) and multimedia artist [Bruce Nauman](https://www.artcomgroup.com/introduce/500photographer/en/nauman.htm), their most iconic works are their self portraits. Then there are other artists such as sculptor [Robert Arneson](https://www.verisimilitudo.com/arneson/artworks.htm) whose body of work consists almost entirely of self portraits. Of course, this focus on the self isn’t limited to visual artists. Writers such as [David Sedaris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjYe_fUBNw0) and comic artists such as [Tenacious D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvvjiE4AdUI) make their living creating autobiographical fiction.

Into this pantheon of artists, I present **Bill Nelson**. He himself may not call himself an artist. His promoted expertise lies in quantum biology, energetic medicine, homeopathy, alternative medicine, and naturopathy — but I am not here to discuss his flimflam approach to medicine.\*

![Desire Dubuonet, aka Bill Nelson](https://catcubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/desire-d.jpg)It is instead his filmmaking that is of interest here: [I-AM Systems – Intelligent Angel Movies](https://www.imune.org), his online film production company — correction, I-AM Systems is actually the creation of **Desire Dubounet**, Bill Nelson’s transvestite alter-ego.

Desire Dubounet’s (aka Bill Nelson) movies are in vis\*\* own words, “a new genre, one could say a new system for making intelligent, necessary entertainment for adults.” Desire has self-produced/directed/written seven feature length films which are all some strange crossbreed between naturopathy promotion and fictionalized autobiographies. Vis work spans a range of genres including western, african survival adventure, and action crime drama. Of course, Desire/Bill stars — and sings! — in all of vis films, as does several of vis family.

Of course the films aren’t good in a traditional sense, and neither is vis singing, but if you view Bill Nelson as an self portrait artist whose medium is not paint but bad film, then ve’s a genius! Truly just stop reading and go watch the trailers now!

- Listen to ver sing in melodramatic baratone “[*Bill’s Theme*](https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2441464197077804024&ei=SfudSLT-M5OerAOyxoEo&q=bill+nelson)” in the trailer for vis movie [Water Wine Homeopathy](https://www.imune.org/films/1), a “film based on Dr Nelson‚Äôs travels to Budapest to defend homeopathy. ACTION PACKED LOVE STORY.” (*sorta NSFW* due to mild violence and snippets of video from inside a strip club)
- Or watch Desire’s stirring drag song “*I Am What I Am*” in the trailer for the movie, [Who`s Afraid of Desire Dubounet?](https://www.imune.org/films/3), “an exciting informative documentary of Desir?© as a real to life action superhero cartoon character.”
- ![Paprika Western](https://catcubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/paprika-western.jpg)Or there’s vis butchered rendition of “*Wanted Dead or Alive*” in the trailer for [Paprika Western](https://www.imune.org/films/8), “It‚Äôs not a spaghetti western it‚Äôs a Paprika Western. The true story of Prof. Nelson‚Äôs family tree dating back to Admiral Nelson and Robert E. Lee. We see the wagon train ride of Prof. Nelson‚Äôs ancestors in 1888 from Kansas to Oregon and back.” (*warning **NSFW*** due to wild west violence and graphic soft core wild west pornography! And also not safe for those easily enraged by vis terribly blatant racist stereotyping of Native-Americans\*\*\*)
- Or there’s vis off-key, off-everything, cover of Paul Simon’s “*Diamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes*” in the trailer for vis movie [Naked Natural Prey](https://www.imune.org/films/9), “a story of a group of explorers who are threatened and or killed by tribesmen in Africa. A FILM THAT TEACHES US ABOUT NATURAL MEDICINE.” (Like the above, not safe for the easily enraged due to horrendously blatant racist stereotyping of blacks as tribal spear-chuckers\*\*\*).

Tossing aside the fact that Desire/Bill is a total [naturopathic snake-oil salesman](https://www.badscience.net/2008/08/bill-nelson-wins-the-internet/), all of vis films are true self portrait masterpieces crafted with a paintbrush dipped in a nauseatingly rich palette of melodramatic bad films and song. Again I’ll let Desire/Bill speak for verself: “Traditional scripts are replaced by a more organic flow, guided and nurtured by Desire’s brilliant ideas producing some of the finest, most spontaneous acting seen on movie screens today.”

<div style="font-size:90%;border:1px solid #ddd;padding:4px">* For a skeptical breakdown of Bill’s flimflam approach to medicine and the Quantum QXCI machine, check out the Bad Science article [Bill Nelson wins the internet](https://www.badscience.net/2008/08/bill-nelson-wins-the-internet/). \*\* **Ve** is a [gender-neutral pronoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_pronoun) first proposed by New Zealand writer Keri Hulme some time in the 1980s and also used by sci-fi writer Greg Egan. I won’t consider myself a proponent of gender neutral pronouns, and I don’t know if Bill/Desire is either, but it just seemed appropriate for the strange story of Desire/Bill.

\*\*\* Desire/Bill sure does like to continue casting POCs using classic racist stereotypes. Like [Michael Richards](www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCbrEbEyheM) I’m sure Desire/Bill would claim that ve wasn’t a racist, but really I see this blatant racism more as an another autobiographical glimpse of who ve really is.
