*This post is brought to you by the fabulous Prim Queer Hostess [Nifercritter](https://nifercritter.livejournal.com/163855.html)*

Last year throngs of leather-clad daddies swooned in shock and horror, when they discovered that **MODESTY IS THE NEW KINK**. Please do join me again this year, for a delightfully ostentatious picnic in the heart of the world’s largest leather event.

[![Prim Queer tea party at the Folsom Faire](https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1035/1464534965_d3d0097406_m.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/headlouse/1464534965/ "Prim Queer tea party at the Folsom Faire by catcubed, on Flickr") Yes, indeed, dear gentleperson, I am hosting a redux of the most photographed event at last year’s Folsom Street Fair — **Miss Nifer’s Prim &amp; Proper Tea Party**. I’m inviting all my queer ladies and gentlepersons of all genders, to **join me at Folsom Street Fair (in the 8th St. Food Court area) on Sunday, September 28, 2008 from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, for the not-to-be-missed \*2nd Annual Prim &amp; Proper Queer Tea Party\***.

Please save the date for this **VERY CONSERVATIVE** affair. We will drink (spiked?) tea from little china cups, and eat little cucumber sandwiches seated upon our quilted blanket, spread out right in the middle of the action.

[![Colin, SFSLim, and Nifer at Prim Queer Tea 2007](https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1166/1473248441_e3be8ca0bc_m.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/loupiote/1473248441/)Miss Nifer Nefarious respectfully requests her guests to adhere to **STRICT “Prim &amp; Proper” attire**. (English tea time, or 1920’s picnic era….)

**Feminine Attire:**  
– BIG sun hats, or -tiny- hats  
– Parasols  
– Long frilly dresses

**Masculine Attire:**  
– Tweed suits  
– Knickerbockers  
– Mustaches  
– Cravats (neck scarves), bow ties, and other ties  
– Bowler hats, Flat-top straw hats, &amp; Newspaper boy caps

Because this is a queer affair, I \*strongly\* encourage you to play with the theme and adopt it to your personal idea of gender identity and orientation….. but please stay within the theme, that “Modesty is the New Kink”. Become inspired by photos of [last year’s Prim Queer Tea](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/primqueertea/):

\*\*\***YOUR participation is essential** to making this event the most refined event at Folsom to date! **PLEASE RSVP today**, so I can organize who is bringing what edibles or other supplies to the picnic, (and also to coordinate our arrival time). Send an email to **sporktree (at) gmail dot com**.\*\*\*

Humping Crumpets,  
Nifer

\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PostScript – Looking for something to bring?
--------------------------------------------

I’m trying to make this AWESOME, however it will help me out TONS if a few people brought things. Check out my list below, and email with what you can bring. **PLEASE ONLY COMMIT TO BRING STUFF IF YOU PLAN ON COMING FOR SURE**. I’d hate to not have a critical item, like cream, if someone doesn’t come. Er, I mean “arrive”. And we surely don’t want to ask a leather daddy for some cream, for who knows what we might get our pot filled with!

### Please RSVP to **sporktree (at) gmail.com** if you can help with any of the following:

\+ Tea cups &amp; saucers (mismatching would be cute! )  
\+ Tea Pots &amp; Tea Kettles  
\+ Napkins &amp; little paper plates  
\+ Large blankets &amp; quilts that can be put on the street (We will need to cover at least a 25 foot square area)  
\+ Some silverware (actual metal would ROCK…. they don’t have to match)  
\+ Silver serving platters (It’s all about the POSH!)

\+ Tea!  
\+ Small Eats – Scones, Tea Biscuits, Crumpets with jars of Devon Cream or Lemon Curd, Petits Fours, Fruit  
\+ Milk &amp; Milk Pitcher/Container  
\+ Sugar Cubes &amp; sugar bowl  
\+ Tea-spiking stuff– whiskey, rum, ??  
\+ Sandwiches (Possible ideas: Cream Cheese &amp; Cucumber, Chutney &amp; English Cheddar, Pear &amp; Stilton Cheese, Fig &amp; Olive Tapenade, Cream Cheese &amp; Mandarin Oranges, Smoked Salmon &amp; Cream Cheese, Egg Salad

I look forward to meeting you all at The Fair!

Your hostess,  
Nifer
