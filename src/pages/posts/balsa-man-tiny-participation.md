[![Is it The Man or Balsa Man!?!](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3156/2805204818_6f5ff9b968_m.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/headlouse/2805204818/ "Is it The Man or Balsa Man!?! by catcubed, on Flickr") Tiny bubbles of inspiration are percolating through the Balsa Man community! Already mentioned in my last post was the **Temple of Reduced Expectations** built by [J-Rad](https://twitter.com/JRadhirsch) and the DTMV (Dept. of Tiny Mutant Vehicles) first registered **RC ArtCar** by [ninavizz](https://twitter.com/ninavizz). Since just yesterday, there’s been even more news of tiny participation! [MissySB](https://twitter.com/MissySB) is now the Vice President of Ingress Information: i.e., she’s coordinating the effort of making the **Balsa Shave 3×5″ entrance signs** — I encourage others to make signs as well as more is sometimes more.

Also, while the BalsArtery doesn’t have any official announcements, rumors abound of more inspired mini-artists out there tooling away. [Hints of more **balsa wood** purchases](https://twitter.com/criollo/statuses/902116022), possible lamplighter posts, and [“**tiny flamular**” demonstrations](https://twitter.com/MissySB/statuses/902191887) have been rippling through the Balsa Man community! At this rate, I wouldn’t be surprised if craft stores start running out of balsa wood and glue!\*

The best way to experience Balsa Man is to participate. The Balsa Man burns in two days, but that’s more than enough time to create your own mini-masterpiece!

\*BTW, if you are looking for balsa wood an other modeling supplies, I highly recommend [Franciscan Hobbies](https://www.yelp.com/biz/franciscan-hobbies-san-francisco), which is where all the lumber for Balsa Man was purchased. The proprietors are really nice and really know their stuff. Also, [Pearl Arts &amp; Crafts](https://www.yelp.com/biz/pearl-art-and-craft-supplies-san-francisco) has a decent amount of modeling supplies and a variety of other art supplies.
