Yesterday, [Danish authorities recently arrested three people](https://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/feb/13/muhammedcartoonrow) allegedly plotting a “terror-related assassination” of Kurt Westergaard, the cartoonist behind the drawing shown below — one of several [printed controversially in September of 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_cartoon). [Today, newspapers across Europe have reprinted the cartoon](https://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/feb/13/muhammadcartoons) to show support for Westergaard and for freedom of speech.

Representatives for the Danish newspaper, Berlingske Tidende, stated, “We are \[reprinting the cartoon\] to document what is at stake in this case, and to unambiguously back and support the freedom of speech that we as a newspaper always will defend.”

Sadly, Westergaard’s life has been completely disrupted by this simple little drawing. He states, “I could not possibly know for how long I have to live under police protection; I think, however, that the impact of the insane response to my cartoon will last for the rest of my life,” he said. “It is sad indeed, but it has become a fact of my life.”

I thought I’d show my own support by posting the cartoon and add a bit of equal opportunity blasphemy with this classic by Serrano Andres.
