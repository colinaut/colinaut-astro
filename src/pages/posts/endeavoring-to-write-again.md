Haven’t written here in a while — since February it looks like. Been a busy March/April:

- Vacation with family in Taos NM: Earthships! Los Alamos! Vistas! Kite flying! Jackrabbits!
- Gearing up for Maker Faire: New NifNaks business cards! collateral! more collateral! packaging!
- Taxes and other stuff that I can’t remember but has certainly kept my life busy!
- Listening to [RadioLab](https://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/) podcasts! …Seriously you must listen to RadioLab.

Anyway, I’ll be writing again soon with a real post as the ache to write has been building within.
