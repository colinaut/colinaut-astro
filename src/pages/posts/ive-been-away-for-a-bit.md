With vacations in Hawaii and campouts on the playa, I’ve gotten outta the habit of blogging lately. Looking to get back into the groove though.

As a warning, my next post is gonna be about this lovely bit of future I now own called the iphone. For those of you sick of iphone discussion, watch this awesome music view and ignore the next post.
