This being San Francisco—which is if not the heart at least the aorta of the intertubes—one would expect all its candidates to have web savvy campaigns. I mean come on this is 2007! If the little town of [Medicine Park, OK](https://www.google.com/maps?q=Medicine+Park,+OK,+USA&sa=X&oi=map&ct=title) (pop. ~400) can have a [blog](https://www.medicinepark.com/blog.php "Medicine Park Posts"), shouldn’t we expect our politicians to be a bit more internet-slick?

### Recap of Round I

In [Round I](https://catcubed.com/2007/07/20/sf-politics-in-the-21st-century/), I covered the web campaigns of [Chicken John](https://voteforchicken.com/) and [Gavin Newsom](https://www.actlocallysf.org/index.php). Neither of them got very many style-points for their web presence, but Chicken John was the winner of that bout with his more personal and direct internet campaign.

### The judges reconsider

However, it seems that the judges missed something in their review: as it turns out, the Gavin Newsom campaign, Act Locally SF\*, has a [flickr account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/newsom2007/), and they have an active [YouTube campaign](https://www.youtube.com/user/GavinNewsom2007 "YouTube: Gavin Newsom 2007"). Mostly it’s just a bunch of long rambling unedited boring meetings, but I love his Pet Peeves on the Streets series!

[![Newsom's got a mic!](https://catcubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/newsom_w_mic.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttoPI5UpRxE&mode=related&search=) The [Pet Peeves on the Streets video series](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pet+peeves+on+the+street&search=) have Gavin Newsom himself interviewing random people on the [street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttoPI5UpRxE) and in [barbershops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl5jZrn1Kr4&mode=related&search=) asking what their pet peeve is with San Francisco. The series is a few months old at this point, but they are a good attempt to reach out to people the way that this new social web is meant to. We need to see more campaign ideas like this.

So with this revelation, I gotta give the **YouTube Stardom** category over to Gavin Newsom, and I’d say the **Web 2.0 Social Aptitude** category is now a tie.

With this turnover, **Gavin Newsom** is now in the lead as the top 21st century political candidate of San Francisco!

### A scrappy new contender

[![Josh Wolf in the sea of greeen](https://catcubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/joshwolf.jpg)](https://joshwolf.net/JoshWolf4Mayor/node/56) However, Gavin Newsom shouldn’t get too cocky. He only won that one by a nose and as Scott Beale of Laughing Squid [reports](https://laughingsquid.com/josh-wolf-for-mayor-of-san-francisco-website-launches/), Josh Wolf seems to be coming out with both guns blazing. He’s got a new blog, [Josh Wolf for Mayor](https://joshwolf.net/JoshWolf4Mayor/) and a [campaign video](https://joshwolf.net/JoshWolf4Mayor/node/56). The judges have yet to completely review but they did have this to say:

> “Please please next time get a tripod and don’t ever sit in front of a nauseatingly bright greenscreen!!!”\*\*

**So stay tuned for Round II where it’s the stiff backed experienced politico Gavin Newsom against the slouched over activist Josh Wolf!**   
*\* I gotta say though that Act Locally SF is a terrible campaign name. It sounds more like a generic NGO then a campaign. Why not just Gavin Newsom 2007?*

\*\* Bonus Points go to anyone out there who takes Josh Wolf’s video and remixes it using the greenscreen background for something Dumb. Note: that’s Dumb with a capital **D**—ya know the kind of Dumb that’s actually funny and creative.
