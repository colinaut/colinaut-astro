</span></div>Oh my this child ruined! Tear that iPad away! Look at the frozen eyes: the child is trapped, sucked in, by consuming! For the love of all that is geeky, give this child an Archos and a screwdriver before they are trapped into being a zombified consumer for the rest of their life instead of fulfilling their destiny as a proper maker/hacker/doctorow!

The iPad is just the gateway to less and less creativity and interaction, the next thing you know they will be laying there passively consuming without even a home button in sight, reading a book made out of old fashioned non-interactive paper.
