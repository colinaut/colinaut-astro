Internet Explorer 7 came upon the scene with uproar for us web developers. *Oh Nooz! What will happen to our precious site designs!?!*

Frankly however, it didn’t really effect many people as long as they designed for standards, avoided messy css hacks, and didn’t use [Active X](https://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-1009_11-6130844.html). Ok admittedly there were probably several web managers who had to overhaul their active x css hack-job of a site. Luckily, I was not one of them.

Instead, I was hoping that IE7 smash like a meteor wiping out almost all instances of crappy IE6. I so dearly wanted to never have to code for IE’s bugs ever again.

I watched my UCSF web stats and at first it seemed promising, but then it hit around 30% and has just stagnated there for the past 6 months. Firefox’s browser share is around 10-12% on and Safari around 3.5%. (on CatCubed Firefox use is around 68% and Safari 11%).

Ugh it seems like I’ll be stuck designing for IE6 for a quite a while.
