[![Random art at The Shipyard](https://farm1.static.flickr.com/144/392723302_42afc3c86d_m.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/qathi/392723302/ "link to photo on flickr ~ photographer Qathi")[Laughing Squid is reporting](https://laughingsquid.com/berkeley-shuts-down-amazing-art-space-the-shipyard/) that [The Shipyard](https://www.theshipyard.org) is closing up shop due to uncompromising Berkeley bureaucracy.

Supposedly, the stacked shipping containers are not structurally sound enough for Berkeley. [Jim Mason](https://www.whatiamupto.com/), the owner of the facility, has received a ‚Äúvacate and abate‚Äù notice unless he can *prove*, in three days, the “shipping containers as a new rated assembly for habitable buildings.”

It’ll be sad to see it go. It had been the home for several fabulous events and art projects including: [How To Destroy The Universe Festival](How%20To%20Destroy%20The%20Universe%20Festival) (2004 &amp; 2005), [The Clock Works](https://www.burningart.com/liam/clockworks.htm) (2005), [Neverwas Haul](https://tribes.tribe.net/neverwas) (2006).

Jim Mason has stated that he is looking to move everything to Oakland. Hopefully, the new home bring less bureaucratic headaches.
