I gotta agree with [Eric Meyer](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/12/13/bad-timing/). The [Opera lawsuit](https://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2007/12/13/) is stupid. The only reason that people don’t install things besides IE these days is laziness, ignorance, and poor marketing on the part of the other browsers.

Not the mention, I like Eric Meyer got no beef with IE7. It ain’t half bad — if only the adoption process was better IE6 is still about 14% for CatCubed and a whopping 50% for the UCSF Fetal Treatment Center.
