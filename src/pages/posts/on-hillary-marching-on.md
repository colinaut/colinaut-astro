So Hillary has endeavored to continue on in her quest for the presidency even though it’s turned from an up hill battle to a up cliff battle. Frankly, I’m alright with that as long as she quiets the negative rhetoric and [“he’ll only get the black voters” bullshit](https://dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/5/8/114550/1998/837/511733). She does still speak for some people: mostly people over 65 and anyone who’s looking for a more hardline version of universal healthcare.

Also, her continuing on does have some benefit for Obama. Even if she were to bow out now, West Virginia and Kentucky would probably be a win for her due to:

- Graying population (WV: 15.3% are over 65; National Avg: 12.4%)
- A lot of “I remember the good old days of good unionized factory jobs” type democrats with lower education levels (WV: 14.8% have a bachelors degree or higher ; National Avg: 24.4%)
- She has Methodist roots (WV 10% of the population) and does well with Catholics (WV 8% of the population)
- And lastly there’s also the potential issue of [racism](https://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/4/26/133958/391)

In any case, if he lost those states to someone who was out of the race, it won’t look good for Obama from a publicity standpoint. With Clinton still in the race it’s less of an publicity issue, and even with those loses the math is strongly tilted in his favor, and he’s strongly lined up to win Oregon anyway.
