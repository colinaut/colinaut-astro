New issue (episode, showing, sequestering, parade?) of Encephalon is out hosted this time on Peripersonal Space: [Encephalon 19: Emotion and Reason Match Postponed Due to Flares on the Pitch, Hooliganism!](https://peripersonalspace.wordpress.com/2007/03/26/encephalon-19-emotion-and-reason-match-postponed-due-to-flares-on-the-pitch-hooliganism/)

Didn’t have time to read all the articles, but I recommend [A neural substrate for moral decisions](https://neurophilosophy.wordpress.com/2007/03/22/a-neural-substrate-for-moral-decisions/).

Hopefully I’ll have time to get back to real reading and posting soon. Been too busy with work, school, side projects and a short but obnoxious bout with a [norovirus](https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwalk_virus_group).
