After months of adding links to del.icio.us links, I’ve finally reached the magic number:  
![](https://catcubed.com/images/delicious_1337.gif)

I’m now a **1337** [del.icio.us user](https://del.icio.us/headlouse)! I’m so proud!

…actually I’ve already added a few more links since capturing this and I’m now 4 greater than 1337!
