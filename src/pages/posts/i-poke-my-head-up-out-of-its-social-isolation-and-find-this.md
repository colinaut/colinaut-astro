Tomorrow, Fri the city goes a bit haywire…

- [Zombiemob](https://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/193662/) – 6pm – starting at market and sutter and heads towards Union Square
- [Pillowfight](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pete_knife/511377268/) – 6pm – Justin Herman Plaza
- [Critical Mass](https://www.critical-mass.org/) – 5:30pm – Justin Herman Plaza
- [North American Courier Championships 2007](https://naccc07sf.com/index2.htm) registration day – 2-6pm – House of Shields

I don’t give a damn about the bike courier, but I do think a very short critical mass and then get taken by zombies along market is in order.
