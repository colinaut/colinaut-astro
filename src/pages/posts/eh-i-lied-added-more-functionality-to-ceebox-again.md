Again I had nifty idea. Use an external JSON file to add more video support so that I and others could release additional video support without releasing the main jquery.ceebox.js file and without increasing to the bulk of ceebox. Makes it easy for sites to add support selectively too so that CeeBox is more an adaptive tool rather than a heavy do everything.

Get it all working too for in the new [CeeBox 2.0.6](https://github.com/catcubed/CeeBox/zipball/v2.0.6)… which also include a bug fix for video galleries. Missed a bug in my checking during the 2.0.5 release.

It’s my first time messing with JSON. Pretty nifty cool stuff.
