Listening happily to Bonobo’s latest album Black Sands. I don’t like all of it but the tracks that are good are damned good. [*24 minutes ago* ](https://twitter.com/catcubed/status/10707782379) *via* [*Tweetie*](https://www.atebits.com/)

I miss Bajka from Days to Come. Andreya Triana is a good singer but she’s almost too smooth with nothing to grab your ear and pull you in. [*8 minutes ago* ](https://twitter.com/catcubed/status/10708302717) *via* [*Tweetie*](https://www.atebits.com/)

1009 is my favorite song on the album. Chill, yet glitchy and always feeling as if it’s on the verge of rocking the house. [*3 minutes ago* ](https://twitter.com/catcubed/status/10708464931) *via* [*Tweetie*](https://www.atebits.com/)
