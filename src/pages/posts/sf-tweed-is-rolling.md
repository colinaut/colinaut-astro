Some of you may have noticed that the new [SF Tweed](https://sftweed.com/20090415-sf-tweed-rides-again/) site has launched and we have announced the next [Tweed Ride](https://sftweed.com/20090415-sf-tweed-rides-again/)!

This labor of love has taken longer than I expected ‚Äî live’s been busy ‚Äî but I’m quite happy with the results. A big thanks to [Rubin Starset](https://rubin.starset.net/) for buying the domain, setting up the WP install, and most of all motivating me to kick out a design and get this thing happening!

I expect to see y’all at the next Tweed Ride as we have some great things planned.
