I pulled in some of my fav psychology related posts and a couple others that exemplify my views on life from my lj account. I timestamped them from when I wrote them so to make it easier to find them here’s da list:

- [Meow?](https://catcubed.com/2006/08/03/meow/) – Where I engage in some unbridled speculation about toxoplasmosis and the crazy cat lady. Includes for your reading pleasure: *Links to actual research! Grand theorizing! Photos of stupid toys! Conjecture that’s only mostly baseless!*
- [Buckaroo Banzai :: Modern Renaissance Man](https://catcubed.com/2007/02/02/buckaroo-banzai-modern-renaissance-man/) – Still after all these years, Buckaroo Banzai is my role model.
- [Playing Altruism Computer Games Inside a Loud Tube](https://catcubed.com/2007/01/24/playing-altruism-computer-games-inside-a-loud-tube/) – fMRI tubes may not be the best place to research altruism.
- [Question Authority?](https://catcubed.com/2007/01/16/question-authority/) – a treatise on my own brand of punkassed scientific skepticism
