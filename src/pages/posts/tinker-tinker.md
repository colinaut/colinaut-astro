Been messing around with the design and various WP plugins.

On the design side, I added a visually interesting divider between posts and broke the sidebar into more intuitive chunks.

For you tag lovers out there, I added the [Ultimate Tag Warrior](https://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior/) plug in, so now there are tags with every post, a tag nav, and a nifty little [Tag Cloud](https://catcubed.com/tag-cloud/) page. As a result of this my nav was getting too long, so I added (slightly tweaked version of) [Fancy Archives](https://nymb.us/projects/show/213) to make the archive a collapsible menu. Behind the scenes, I also added the awesome [WordPress Tiger Administration](https://orderedlist.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-tiger-administration/), which makes my admin tasks much more enjoyable.
