[![Photo of Bill Moyers](https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/images/topbanner_01.jpg)](https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/btw/watch.html "Photo of Bill Moyers")Bill Moyers had a special last night called “Buying the War” about the press’s failure leading up to the Iraq war. I don’t watch TV like normal people do so luckliy they posted it, so you can [watch the video online](https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/btw/watch.html).

I started watching it during my lunch break, and it’s really good, detailed, and hard hitting. Of course, little of it surprises me and it’s several years too late, but still I highly recommend it.

p.s. since it’s mostly lots of talking you can also just treat it like radio and listen to it while you work like I’m doing.
