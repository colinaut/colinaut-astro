[![Delhi, India - Cows in the Mist](https://farm1.static.flickr.com/23/92133946_4314287027_m.jpg "Delhi, India - Cows in the Mist")](https://www.flickr.com/photos/headlouse/92133946/ "Flickr Photo Sharing")I couldn’t take it any longer. I had to add my Cat Cubed logo and to do that I needed to change the background pic in the header and make a few color changes. If you’re wondering the photo is a lime greenized version of a picture I took in India of “Cows in the Mist.”

Yeah it’s arbitrary.

It’s nowhere close to what I want this site to look like‚Äîactually I’m not exactly sure what I want it looking like. It’ll do for now though.
