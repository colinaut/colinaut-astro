Oh gato there is so much ugly here! Too much to even bother to list. **Benjamin Franklin looks like a Martian Pimp** with his purple suit and green head. And who the hell thought it needed a [giant orange Helvetica](https://gethelveticaoffourmoney.com/) 100 like it was some old person’s tv remote? AHHHHH!

Compare this to the last design that was unveiled in 1996…

If you really care you can watch the horrible [$100 unveiling video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwEBIC0a4RY) put out by the goverment. More on the previous incarnations of the [100 dollar bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_one_hundred-dollar_bill)
