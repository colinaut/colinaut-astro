[CeeBox](https://catcubed.com/2008/12/23/ceebox-a-thickboxvideobox-mashup/) is now a full fledged [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) plugin. I’m pretty proud as this is the first full fledged jquery plugin I’ve ever coded.

You can download it directly from github: <del datetime="2009-10-07T16:37:27+00:00">[Ceebox 1.4](https://github.com/catcubed/CeeBox/zipball/v1.4)</del> <ins datetime="2009-10-07T16:37:27+00:00">Make that [CeeBox 1.4.1](https://github.com/catcubed/CeeBox/zipball/v1.4.1) (I found a small error in the minimized css file and then decided to reorganize the css file a bit to make it easier to change graphics)</ins>

Make that

If you are running [CeeBox 1.3.4](https://catcubed.com/stuff/ceebox-1.3.4.zip) and it makes you happy feel free to skip this upgrade. There is no additional functionality (though it is slightly more usable as a jquery plugin). I did however do a bit more code optimization reducing the size of the minimized version to 8.4KB which is smaller than a majority of the lightbox-like plugins out there—it’s even slightly smaller than Thickbox which this was originally inspired from.

**Screenshot of it in operation (Note the next button which is the right side of the image is rolled over):**

I am also working on making a WordPress plugin out of this. Actually I did create a basic CeeBox wordpress plugin already but it is not ready for release.
