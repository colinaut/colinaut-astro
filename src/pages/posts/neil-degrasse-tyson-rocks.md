![Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://catcubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/abou-tyson2.jpg)The subject line quotes a recent twitter made by a friend of mine and I couldn’t agree more. [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://research.amnh.org/~tyson/), is the exuberant astrophysicist who is the host for [NOVA Science Now](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow/) and the director of the [Hayden Planetarium](https://www.haydenplanetarium.org/). He explodes with a passion for the mysteries of the universe in a way only an atheist could. His cheerful enthusiasm for science is contagious and in that way many have compared him to the late [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan); however, Tyson is really a unique figure.

One of my favorite blogs [One Good Move](https://onegoodmove.org/1gm/) recently posted a great video clip from [Neil deGrasse Tyson’s recent interview on the Daily Show](https://onegoodmove.org/1gm/1gmarchive/2007/07/neil_degrasse_t.html "Neil deGrasse Tyson's July 2007 Daily Show interview"). He was also [previously interviewed on the Daily Show](https://onegoodmove.org/1gm/1gmarchive/2007/01/death_by_black.html "Neil deGrasse Tyson's January 2007 Daily Show interview") in January of this year for his book [Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries](https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDeath-Black-Hole-Cosmic-Quandaries%2Fdp%2F0393062244%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1170262935%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&tag=onegoodmove-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325 "Amazon Link").

Neil deGrasse Tyson was also a speaker at the [Beyond Belief 2006](https://beyondbelief2006.org/) conference. I know I’ve mentioned this conference before, but I feel the need to mention it again. I seldom watch many things more than once, but I find myself going back and listening to Neil deGrasse Tyson the most. His [rebuke to Dawkins](https://onegoodmove.org/1gm/1gmarchive/2006/11/beyond_belief.html) (short and poignant), his [connection between art and the love of science](https://onegoodmove.org/1gm/1gmarchive/2006/11/the_soul_of_a_n.html) (16min speech that is absolutely amazing and energizing), and [much more on YouTube](https://youtube.com/results?search_query=Neil+deGrasse+Tyson&search=) are all worth watching.

In my book, he’s right up there with [Buckaroo Banzai](https://catcubed.com/2007/02/02/buckaroo-banzai-modern-renaissance-man/).
