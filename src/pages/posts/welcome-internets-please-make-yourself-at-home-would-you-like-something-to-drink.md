[TUAW](https://www.tuaw.com) has [posted](https://www.tuaw.com/2007/08/15/the-perfect-iphone-email-setup/ "The perfect iPhone email setup") about the [iPhone/Gmail/IMAP email hybrid setup tutorial](https://catcubed.com/2007/07/23/gmail-imap-and-iphones-part-2-the-tutorial/) I created. And now the internet horde has come making my earlier site stats look laughable.

As all you new here may notice, I commit the number one sin of blogging by not focusing on any one topic. My interests are eclectic ranging from [web design](https://catcubed.com/tag/web-design), [neuroscience](https://catcubed.com/tag/neuroscience) and [psychology](https://catcubed.com/tag/psychology), [online health care](https://catcubed.com/tag/health-care), [art](https://catcubed.com/tag/art), cultural commentary, [politics](https://catcubed.com/tag/politics), and the artist freak scene here in [San Francisco](https://catcubed.com/tag/sf-bay-area). If I had all the time in the world, I could probably produce enough content to support a blog about each of these topics.

Instead of spreading myself thin and risking blog abandonment, I write this one single blog and write detailed and researched posts about whatever is motivating me at the moment. Some of my favorite and well received posts include:

- [My Rhymes Are So Dop‚Ä¶ amine](https://catcubed.com/2007/02/18/my-rhymes-are-so-dop-amine/) – a laymen’s primer on the dopamine
- [Is that a cockscomb in your pocket?](https://catcubed.com/2007/05/25/is-that-a-cockscomb-in-your-pocket) – discussion of John Stewart’s role as America’s court jester
- [SF Politics in the 21st century](https://catcubed.com/2007/07/20/sf-politics-in-the-21st-century/) – humorous discussion of the online SF Mayoral campaigns of Gavin Newsom and Chicken John
- Also related to my work at UCSF I’ve posted about [Pediatric Blogging](https://catcubed.com/2007/03/21/pediatric-blogging/), [Patient Blogging](https://catcubed.com/2007/03/21/patient-blogging/), and the [lame attempts at health care information Second Life](https://catcubed.com/2007/02/19/lacking-a-second-life/).

I hope you find the iPhone email tutorial useful. I don’t run ads here <del datetime="2007-08-17T22:04:28+00:00">or have a donation button</del> <ins class="insertBlock" datetime="2007-08-17T22:10:22+00:00">By request of one of my visitors, I’ve now added a PayPal Tip Jar to my blog over in the right hand sidebar under my photo. It did take me a bit of effort to figure all this out and write it up. And I’ve been busier then I expected answering everyone’s questions, so if you find this useful toss a couple bucks in so I can buy myself a drink or something!   
Thanks!

p.s. You can also say thanks by sashaying over to my partner’s site, [NifNaks](https://nifnaks.com/), and checking out her adorable handmade wool dreads, wool critters, accessories — my favorite being the [Flying Spaghetti Monster pin](https://nifnaks.com/creations-shop/accessories/flying-spaghetti-monster-lapel-pin/detailed-product-flyer.html). Both her and I have poured a lot of time and love into NifNaks and would appreciate the company over there as well.
