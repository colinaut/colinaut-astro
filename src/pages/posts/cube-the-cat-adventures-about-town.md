I will continue taking pictures of my own Cube the Cat as he explores the world, but I would be overjoyed to see other Cube the Cat’s out there. If you are inspired to make your own Cube, please take pictures and add them to the pool!

I know there is already one other [Cube the Cat out in Medicine Park](https://yfrog.com/4eybgj)!
