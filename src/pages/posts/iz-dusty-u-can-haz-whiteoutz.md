<div style="float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px"> [![](https://farm1.static.flickr.com/245/524568722_609668d9a0_m.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/headlouse/524568722/ "photo sharing")</div>Just got word via email from Nifer &amp; Slim who are already on the playa.

Remember all the predictions about it being a dusty year? Well da playa is living up the hype.

They’ve been up there since Sat and there have been major whiteouts both days. Good goggles without vents are obviously a must — their suggested getting ski or motorcross goggles rather than cheap-ass raver goggles.

Also if this keeps up, you’ll need something to stop your lungs from filling up completely with playa. If you have respirator masks bring them — in the very very least a bandana. Otherwise your lungs will be screaming “Do Not Want!”

**YOU HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY WARNED**
