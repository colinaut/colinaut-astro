So it seems like [my Cat Lady hypothesis](https://catcubed.com/2006/08/03/meow/) linking toxoplasmosis and crazy cattitude that I blogged about in August of 2006 seems to have taken root elsewhere in the scientific community. The New York Times is [reporting](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/magazine/09_10_catcoat.html?_r=1&ref=magazine&oref=slogin) that the crazy idea may not be so crazy.

It’s a rather simple leap in logic for anyone who knows the effects of toxoplasmosis, so I’m not surprised that someone else glommed onto the idea. However, I like to think that I may have helped it percolate to the surface, so now it can get some actual scientific study.
