The Society of Homeopaths is holding a [symposium on the treatment of AIDS](https://www.badscience.net/2007/09/homeopathy-gives-you-aids/ "Homeopathy gives you AIDS (BadScience.net)") in December. Their [flier](https://www.homeopathy-soh.org/for-homeopaths/documents/Aidsflyer.pdf) states that “Harry van der Zee will introduce us to a completely different and controversial treatment for AIDS in Africa using a new set of healing remedies created by Peter Chappell.”

And what is this “completely different and controversial treatment” you ask? He offers “healing downloads”:

> “Downloads are based upon resonance which is an ancient principle for healing and resonance is a natural law that has always existed. Modern quantum physics is confirming resonance works on all levels of existence.”

And how do you get these “healing downloads”? Well he sells them on iTunes of course “engrafted” onto jazz music!

> “The music is simply the carrier and alerts you to listen. The download is engrafted on the music by a special process. That is the new technology.”

Hell maybe we can just preload his quantum engrafted ancient healing resonance music on all those [XO Laptops](https://laptop.org/)! That’ll solve the African AIDS crisis in no time!

### ugh

It’s this sorta shit that pisses me off about hemopathology and all the other new ager placebo crap. I’m not gonna even bother disproving hemopathology for you here as [others have done it better than me](https://www.badscience.net/2007/11/a-kind-of-magic/ "The end of homeopathy? (BadScience.net)").

I ran into someone tangentially in my social circle the other day who exclaimed the benefits of using magnets to balance the body. I admit that my initial response was mildly snarky, and in turn their response was basically an outright distrust of “western medicine” because that’s “how \[they\] were raised.” For them it had become a religion.

Reiki, acupuncture, hemeopathology, prayer, MMR vaccine hysteria, witch doctors, raping virgins to get rid of AIDS — it’s all part of the same circle of faith-based medicine. At best it’s hucksterism sucking money out of wallets of dupes; and at worst it’s spreading disinformation and killing patients who forgo vaccines and real treatment. Obviously, it’s mostly the latter that pisses me off about the former.

When faced with this sorta new ager stuff (fairly common here in San Francisco), I think it’s important to challenge these ideas. However, it can be hard not to come off sounding disdainful (because frankly that’s basically how I feel).

Any other skeptics out there have ways of approaching these conversations?
