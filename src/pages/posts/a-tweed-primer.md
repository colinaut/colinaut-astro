I suggest initially perusing the numerous thrift stores in the Mission: [Community Thrift](https://www.yelp.com/biz/community-thrift-store-san-francisco) and [Thrift Town](https://www.yelp.com/biz/thrift-town-san-francisco-2) both have several varieties of tweed wear. Once you have scavenged the racks of these and other thrift stores, I recommend adding the finishing touches at vintage establishments such as [Mission Thrift](https://www.yelp.com/biz/mission-thrift-san-francisco) or any of the number of [dashing](https://www.yelp.com/biz/held-over-san-francisco) [vintage](https://www.yelp.com/biz/decades-of-fashion-millesime-san-francisco) [shops](https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-rosa-vintage-san-francisco) on the Haight.

### What is tweed you may ask?

[Tweed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweed_(cloth)) is the rough unfinished wool you found in classic informal outdoor jackets. Tweed can be designed plain or patterned in check, [herringbone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herringbone_(cloth)), plaid, or other styles. Moisture resistant and durable, it is perfect for cycling in all kinds of weather! Of course any wool jacket can look just as dashing as tweed, but it won’t keep you as warm.

Of course, **Tweed-style is not only about tweed**. A proper cyclist looks good from head to toe: from the dashing wool cap, to the silk scarf, ascot, or bow tie accenting the neck, to the snappy knickers or skirts, and or course the argyle socks! For socks I highly recommend the online shop [Sock Dreams](https://www.sockdreams.com). For inspiration, I suggest perusing [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/booksnake/sets/72157612948036480/) from the lovely [London Tweed Run](https://www.flickr.com/photos/roxysreal/sets/72157612934832373/).
