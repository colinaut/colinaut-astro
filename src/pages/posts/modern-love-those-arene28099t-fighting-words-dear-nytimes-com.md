<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">> I’d recently committed to a non-negotiable understanding with myself. I’d committed to “The End of Suffering.” I’d finally managed to exile the voices in my head that told me my personal happiness was only as good as my outward success, rooted in things that were often outside my control. I’d seen the insanity of that equation and decided to take responsibility for my own happiness. And I mean all of it.

<div class="posterous_quote_citation">via [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/02/fashion/02love.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all)</div>One of the best examples of owning one’s feelings and one’s happiness I’ve read in a long while. In the face of a husband in a mid-life crisis who was determined to destroy their marriage, this woman showed more strength, self confidence, and self control than most people could ever manage. And as a result, saved their marriage.

I recommend that all my recently married friends read this woman’s experience.
