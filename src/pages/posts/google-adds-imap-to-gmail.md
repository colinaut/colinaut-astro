Looks like Google has finally added [IMAP support to gmail](https://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?ctx=gmail&hl=en&answer=75725). Found out today via Gruber’s [twitter](https://twitter.com/gruber/statuses/359115122) and then noticed that [Slashdot just noted it](https://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/10/24/0249257) today.

This sorta makes my whole [gmail/IMAP/iPhone instructions obsolete](https://catcubed.com/2007/07/23/gmail-imap-and-iphones-part-2-the-tutorial/) except for the whole using gmail as an archive thing. If you use gmail’s IMAP directly (rather then a routed approach like mine) you still have the problem of it downloading all your messages.

As such, I’m not currently planning on switching over to this from my own system. <del datetime="2007-10-24T05:46:23+00:00">Another issue is that I wouldn’t be able just read/respond/delete as I have been doing, since I’d be deleting off of what is now my main archive</del>. <ins datetime="2007-10-24T05:46:23+00:00">Actually reading [this](https://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=77657) it looks like delete just acts like archive unless a mail is spam or in trash.</ins> Also you’d still need to send out through your other account if you wanted to use a different header email, since Exchange doesn’t like emails sent through gmai with a different header.

However, this does open up the possibility of using a different gmail account as the iphone IMAP pool for people who were hunting for an IMAP account but still like my system.
