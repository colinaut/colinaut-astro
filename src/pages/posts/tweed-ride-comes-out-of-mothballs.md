In case you haven’t heard we are planning another Tweed Ride on March 27th in Berkeley. I am really pleased with the design for the flyer. It plays off my earlier flyer for the [second SF Tweed Ride](https://www.flickr.com/photos/headlouse/3469762997/) with some similar elements and uses the same typeface, but the balance of the layout is different as is the color palette. Designing the promotional material is one of the more fun aspects of these events that I put on. Of course, the most fun is the smiles I see on the faces of the participants!

Spring is the air and the rain has let up, so it’s time to dust off your smoking pipes and take your tweed out of mothballs! Put that dapper cap on your head, oil your chain, and get ready to pedal with panache!

Join us for the first SF Tweed Ride of 2010, this ride will take place in the lovely town of Berkeley, CA. The ride will be anywhere from 5-7 miles with a break midway through. We have plenty of enjoyment planned for you all including games, contests, and a special performance by the wondrous [Corpus Callosum](https://www.corpus.cc/)! As always, the tweed ride will end at an establishment that offers libations and cheer.
