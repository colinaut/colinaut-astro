After several late nights all this past week, a full day of photoshoots, compounded headache inducing FTP issues, and lots of other delays the new design for [NifNaks](https://nifnaks.com "NifNaks Creations") is ready to face the world. The photos turned out fabulous and Nifer’s art really speaks for itself!

The site it self is still beta: plenty more photos still need to go up, and the store needs a bit more work before it’s ready to go online. Obviously, I still have work ahead of me, I’m tired, but I’m happy—I think it’s one of the best designs I’ve ever done.
