I’ve sorted, titled, tagged, and uploaded my pictures to Flickr. The above shot is one of my favorite shots and it was just taken on a lowly 1st gen iPhone ‚Äî proving the best camera is the one you have. There are a bunch of other nice shots in the set too. You can find the entire set [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/headlouse/sets/72157620052008733/).
