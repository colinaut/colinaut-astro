[Burning Man preparation](https://www.burningman.com/preparation/) has begun to take over my life. As I mentioned in [my last post](https://catcubed.com/2007/08/19/iz-dusty-u-can-haz-whiteoutz/ "IZ DUSTY! U CAN HAZ WHITEOUTZ!"), it’s looking to be a dusty year. Hopefully we won’t see a return of the the 3 day long [condition alpha storm](https://www.damer.com/pictures/events/burningman2002/blowout/alphaguide.html) of 2002. In any case, I’m bringing my respirator and my patience.

I leave on Monday, and I won’t have much time for CatCubed, nor will I have much time to respond to questions concerning my [Gmail, IMAP, iPhone setup](https://catcubed.com/2007/07/23/gmail-imap-and-iphones-part-2-the-tutorial/). If your question is easy, I’ll shoot you a response; however if it takes more time, it will have to wait till I return.
