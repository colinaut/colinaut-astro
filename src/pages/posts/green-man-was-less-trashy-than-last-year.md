 </span></div>According to Danger Ranger, playa cleanup wasn’t too bad this year in spite of the record turnout. Frankly I’m surprised yet pleased. Also pretty cool is that “the Bureau of Land Management has adopted the Burning Man standard for Leave No Trace and now requires all large scale events held on public lands in the United States to meet this level of clean up.”

Very much in contrast to the anti-leave-no-trace trash heap that was post-folsom streeet fair. We of [Prim Queer Tea](https://www.flickr.com/photos/headlouse/1464511587/) did our best to clean up our area, which left a clean blank spot surrounded by fliers, plastic beer cups, and assorted trash.
