I’ve been using [Posterous](https://posterous.com/) for a bit now and I really like it. Though I do hope they make an upgrade to the bookmarklet so that tags are easier to include when posting ‚Äî their [current solution](https://blog.posterous.com/posterous-launches-easy-post-t) for this is rather kludgey.

Posterous is interesting as I’ve also learned how I use it, which is different than how I use my other means of sharing things I have found on the world wild web:

- My [Delicious links](https://delicious.com/catcubed) I use primarily for myself. As I use multiple computers it’s a means to store all the links I may want to keep in a easy to search place that is independent of any machine. Basically, I add links to delicious with little care if anyone else finds them interesting.
- My [Google Reader shared items](https://www.google.com/reader/shared/user/00170192886383847618/state/com.google/broadcast) is basically just for sharing nifty blog reads with others, and I only use it while reading things in Google Reader. I mean I guess I could use the Note in Reader bookmarklet to share items while websurfing, but for some reason it doesn’t seem like the right use.
- So now I’m also using posterous which you can see at [links.catcubed.com](https://links.catcubed.com). Which I’ve found is perfect for grabbing little random web snippets that I find here and there; namely, pictures and video I want to share.

Posterous is also nice as it allows you to autopost back to your blog or twitter or facebook or whereever ‚Äî though as I hate the idea of posting everything everywhere, I wish the bookmarklet had more fine-grained control over this.

I’ve found through use of posterous that I don’t use it really often so I’ve decided to let it autopost to my Catcubed blog; this way they will find their way into my rss stream which I want. However, at the same time as I don’t want the front page of CatCubed to be cluttered with random shared links, so I’ve set up¬†I’ve set up wordpress using the [Advanced Category Excluder](https://advanced-category-excluder.dev.rain.hu/) plugin to exclude all uncategorized posts from the front page. This seems like the easiest solution as all I need to do is add a category as a tag and it’ll no longer be uncategorized and thus will showup on the front page.

Anyway, I bet you don’t care about any of this, but I find it useful to write about my process.
