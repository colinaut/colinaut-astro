Somebody with more programming chops and time than I have needs to create a real time twitter voting tracker!

[Bryan Person](https://www.bryper.com/2008/02/05/tracking-votes-from-the-twitterati-ranks-with-ivoted-account/) smartly set up a [ivoted twitter account](https://twitter.com/ivoted). You don’t have to add him just twitter @ivoted (adding who you voted for is optional) and he’ll get the replies. Sadly he didn’t take it that one extra genius step and create a graphing tracker.

Ideally this graphing tracker would show @ivoted replies (and maybe “I voted” search totals) charted by time and with candidate totals for ivoted posts that mention a candidate.

Until some code monkey warrior takes up this challenge, you can watch the replies yourself in real time using a [tweetscan search for ivoted](https://tweetscan.com/index.php?s=%40ivoted&u=) or a [tweetscan search for “i voted”](https://tweetscan.com/index.php?s=%22I+voted%22&u=).

Also Bryan has mentioned that he will publish the results on his blog, [The Bryper Blog](https://www.bryper.com/).

p.s. I also highly recommend [Politweets](https://politweets.com/), the well designed political twitter aggregator.

p.p.s. You can follow the actual results along with watch twitter feeds via the [Google Super Tuesday Map](https://maps.google.com/decision2008) or add the [election results gadget](https://gmodules.com/ig/creator?synd=open&hl=en&url=https://gmaps-samples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/elections/2008/miniresults/miniresults.xml?1) to your blog, or read up on the news at Google’s [Elections section](https://news.google.com/?topic=el&promo_msg=el).
