Inspired by Laughing Squid’s use of the awesomely easy to use [Posterous](https://posterous.com) to post random web links at [links.laughingsquid.com](https://links.laughingsquid.com/), I have now set up the same for myself at [links.catcubed.com](https://links.catcubed.com). The main [CatCubed blog](https://catcubed.com) will still be used for all my meaty posts, but I wanted something for all those little “hey this is cool” link posts that I didn’t want to clutter CatCubed with.

So if you are interested in the odd things I come across on the web, you can follow that on [links.catcubed.com](https://links.catcubed.com) — though the majority of my blog reading will still be shared via google reader (see my [google reader shared items](https://www.google.com/reader/shared/00170192886383847618))

Ok, ok, so yeah I’m spread out. If you really are the type who wants to see everything in one giant congealed rss feed you can follow me via [FriendFeed](https://friendfeed.com/catcubed). Maybe I should follow [Rubin’s lead and add a lifestream](https://rubin.starset.net/socialstream/) on my site, but that’s rather low priority.
