I’ve been contemplating revamping CatCubed. As I mentioned in my [last post](https://catcubed.com/2009/04/25/new-catcubeds-random-snippets/), I’ve taken notice of [Rubin Starset’s lifestream](https://rubin.starset.net/impulse/) page and while I still dislike the firehose that is a lifestream, I’ve been thinking that there may be a useful middle ground. While I like my current design I never really cared for the clutter of the right columns. As I read somewhere recently, *right sidebars are the junk drawer of websites*.

Coincidentally, Daniel Miessler just wrote about this very topic in a post entitled [A Better Website Concept: A Lifestream Interface](https://dmiessler.com/blog/a-better-website-concept-a-lifestream-interface). He makes the distinction that there is a difference between **created** content verses **found** content; and he uses the incredibly useful [Yahoo Pipes](https://pipes.yahoo.com/) to dump all the found content (google reader, last.fm, stumbleupon, digg, reedit, etc.) into a rss feed he calls Discovered. Still he then goes on to dump it in the sidebar like before.

This is a nice division and I might choose to use it myself ‚Äî maybe a tabbed approach? **Created**, **Found**, and maybe **All of the Above** with the only sidebar widget being About and Twitter? We’ll see, though I do have more pressing projects on my plate at the moment so this might have to wait.
