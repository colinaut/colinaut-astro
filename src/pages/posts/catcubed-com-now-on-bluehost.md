Not that any of you would notice nor care but I’ve finally gotten this site off of Godaddy, the “used car salemen” of hosting providers. Been using bluehost for a while with nifnaks.com and I like them. Finally ported catcubed.com over to the same shared account. Saves me some money and saves me the headache of looking at the annoying godaddy interface.
