Nor will we sully ourselves by “corking” — or whatever it is the kids call it these days.

Our [fine brethren in jolly old England](https://www.cyclelicio.us/2009/01/tweed-run.html) really know how to sport a cap, so I say, so shall we!

### Thus, February 12th will mark the inaugural Thursday Tweed Ride!

Break out your dashing wool finery, smartly set that cap on your head, straighten your tie, and join us for a fine ride through the grand city of San Francisco!

<div style="font-size:90%;">*[Tea time photo](https://www.flickr.com/photos/carnivillain/2902372542/) of me by [Neil Girling](https://theblight.net/)*</div>We will sally forth from the gorgeous **Dolores Park** near the majestic bell at the 19th Street entrance. The ride will begin at **6:30pm** and from there we will peddle a winding course through the streets — waving to all the beautiful faces we see along the way.

Of course as it is February, it may be brisk out and maybe even a little wet, but your wool should keep you warm and dry! However, if the cold still seeps through never fear as our destination is **Irish coffee** at the marvelous [Tosca Cafe](https://www.yelp.com/biz/tosca-cafe-san-francisco)!

<ins class="insertBlock" datetime="2009-02-09T18:36:43+00:00">As a note to all you Tweed Riders: Thursday‚Äôs weather shows a small chance of light showers. While dry would be ideal, this is fine as Tweed‚Äôs great in rain ‚Äî it‚Äôs made for the outdoors. Also, if it begins to really rain, we‚Äôve planned spirit stops to stay warm!</ins>
