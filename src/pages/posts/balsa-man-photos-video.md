 More pictures and video are starting to surface on the internet from Balsa Man 2008. I’ve created a [Balsa Man 2008 Flickr group](https://www.flickr.com/groups/balsaman2008) to collect all the best shots from the event

Note, yes I failed to raise the arms. Torch in hand, I was too eager to light it. Well the majesty of the burn made up for it and at least now I have at least one way it will be better next year. How else will The Balsa Man be better next year?

- We have a theme for 2009 **“Big Dreams Writ Small”** — build a small maquette of the huge art project you always dreamed of building.
- We’ll have more time set aside for viewing the fabulous art.
- I’ll be conducting more burn tests, so it can burn even more grand! This burn was pretty amazing but we can make it better.
- I’ll be designing a more impressive platform for next year’s Balsa man that relates to the theme.
- Oh and I’m thinking lasers, cause lasers make everything better.
- And of course the Balsa Man will improve most due to the creativity and spirit of the Balsa Man community!

***See you all next year — keep the tiny Balsa Man community spirit alive!***
