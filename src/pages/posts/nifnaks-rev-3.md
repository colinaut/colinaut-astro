Been a bit dry here lately as I’ve been busy busy revamping NifNaks. My revision 2 design was cute but the navigation just wasn’t flexible enough. Also I had been struggling with a couple of issues with [CubeCart](https://cubecart.com), my ecommerce engine, for a while.

So I decided to take a leap and try revamping the entire backend with [Joomla](https://joomla.org/)/[Virtuemart](https://virtuemart.net). Thankfully this leap paid off in spades. It was still a lot of work, with a couple late late nights, but it all pulled together faster than I thought, and I gotta say I like the admin of Joomla way better than CubeCart. There were a couple struggles getting the credit card processing working and couple other things, but I got most of it fixed.

It works, it’s got products, it accepts credit cards, and I’m happy with the design. Yay!

*Still to do:* transfer over all the old blog content and set up url redirects; help Nifer add more products; fix those little picayune things that still bother me aesthetically.
