The [latest edition](https://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/2007/02/encephalon_no_17_piratestyle.php) of the psychology and neuroscience writing carnival *Encephalon* is being hosted by *Pure Pedantry*.

I’m glad to see that Chris Chatham’s excellent [Dopamine for Dummies](https://scienceblogs.com/developingintelligence/2007/02/dopamine_for_dummies.php) post made it in this edition.
