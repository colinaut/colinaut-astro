Because of [Noisebridge](https://noisebridge.net) tonight I:

- Finalized the logo for the Timescale project
- Further personalized my new MacBook Pro and Safari with [Glims](https://www.machangout.com/) and [SafariStand](https://hetima.com/safari/stand-e.html) and more misc.
- talked about random webdev geek stuff
- Upgraded my WordPress install
- Wrote this post

My original plans for the night? Going home and playing Fallout 3. Granted that would have been pretty fun, but Iâ€™m glad I came here.
