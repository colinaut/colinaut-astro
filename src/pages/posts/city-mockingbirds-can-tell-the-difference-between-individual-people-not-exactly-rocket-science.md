<div>> ![Mockingbird_divebomb.jpg](https://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/upload/2009/05/city_mockingbirds_can_tell_the_difference_between_individual/Mockingbird_divebomb.jpg)The mockingbird has the remarkable ability to tell the difference between individual humans, regardless of the clothes they wear. After less than a minute, they can tell one person from another and adjust their responses according to the threat they pose to its nest. This ability suggests that these birds are both intelligent and very flexible in their behaviour – two traits that must surely stand them in good stead in the urban jungle.

> It obviously benefits an animal to be able to distinguish between threatening and harmless species, but discriminating between individuals of the same species is a much more difficult task – just think about how difficult you would find it to tell the difference between two mockingbirds by eye.
