[![](https://farm1.static.flickr.com/91/245112076_702c3fb13c_m.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ioerror/245112076/in/photostream/ "Flickr link") I still wasn’t quite happy with the design, so I changed it again. This time I’m using the 3 column version of the Fjords 01 by [Peterandrej](https://www.peterandrej.com/wordpress/) as my template. To personalize it, I added my favorite pic of me at Burning Man 2006 above the about column. It’s an infrared film shot of me taken by a fabulous photographer friend of mine [Jacob Appelbaum](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ioerror/).

With that photo as my guide, I used [pic2color](https://www.pic2color.com/) to get it’s color palette. These colors served as a basis for the new gradated quasi duotone of “Cows in the Mist.” Then I added the start of a bit of design flair with the transparent white polygon lines. The background pattern is courtesy of [Squidfingers](https://www.squidfingers.com/patterns/).

It’s bound to change some more. I’ll probably wake up tomorrow and hate something else about it.

p.s. I’m posting this with the awesome [Performancing](https://performancing.com/firefox) Firefox extension which I highly recommend.
