Been a bit crazy in my world lately, and I haven’t had much of chance to update this blog in a while. Actually have started on a few posts, but haven’t had time to finish them. They are just sitting there in my drafts staring at me.

So what have I been up to you ask?

- Normal work has been keeping me busy
- I had one week of a bad chest cold (the same one everyone else got)
- I’ve been working on new logo designs for interpretive arson
- I’m working on a new event (more on this later)
- I’ve been poring lots of time into helping Nifer with [NifNaks.com](https://www.nifnaks.com) (check out her new [datawormz flashdrives](https://www.nifnaks.com/creations-shop/geek/gizzy-the-data-worm-4gb-usb-flashdrive/detailed-product-flyer.html) they’re awesome!)
- And I’ve been trying to work in some social life in order to keep myself sane (went to the [Maze Party](https://sanfrancisco.tribe.net/event/NEXUS-MAZE-PARTY-SAT-NOV-10th-LINEUP-AND-INFO/san-francisco-ca/98c8f96c-925a-43cb-842e-58b30fa85e7d&ei=Njw7R-KiEqSqpwTjg_T1Cw&usg=AFQjCNFPGIHxg0CEL5DRbhI5pOsM2lHHiA&sig2=1Srp9vPhWyL0gqu0t4h0iw) in Half Moon Bay which was a whole lot of fun)

I miss my blog writing so I hope to squeeze in a bit more time for this soon.
