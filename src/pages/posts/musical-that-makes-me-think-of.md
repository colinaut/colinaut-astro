Thanks to the internet (namely YouTube) and our household varied massive music libraries, myself and [@maledictive](https://twitter.com/maledictive) were able to play an impromptu game of musical “That Makes Me Think Of” while engaged in a [NifNaks](https://www.nifnaks.com) felting extravaganza In order of play and marked by who played which song (**myself**|*maledictive*) here’s our evening’s set list.
