In light of the recent [Greanpeace health report on the iPhone](https://www.macworld.com/news/2007/10/15/greenpeace/index.php "macworld article") (view the [PDF of Full Report](https://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/iPhones-hazardous-chemicals.pdf)), I’ve taken the proactive stance and created a health warning for use as my iPhone wallpaper.

I am releasing this wallpaper to the world in order to do my part in saving us all from the iPhone health menace! By downloading and installing this image as the wallpaper of your iPhone, you’ll be proactively protecting the health of babies and lab rats everywhere!
