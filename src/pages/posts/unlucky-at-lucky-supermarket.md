I often shop at [Lucky Supermarket](https://www.luckysupermarkets.com/). Not because I like to but because it’s only 2 blocks from my house. My housemates and I have our own slogan for them: *“Lucky Supermarket, your lucky if they have it in stock”*. The thing that most gets me though is their “sale” pricing. There is often no rhyme or reason behind it—with items often priced with $0.00 off or oddities.

Anyways, I set up a Tumbler blog just to post the inanities I often find there: [**Unlucky at Lucky Supermarket**](https://unluckysupermarket.tumblr.com/)
