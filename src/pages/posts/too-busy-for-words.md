Sadly I haven’t been able to update Cat Cubed for a bit. I’ve been too busy with helping with all that is [NifNaks](https://nifnaks.com), taxes, and financial hassles. [UCSF has a server breach](https://pub.ucsf.edu/newsservices/releases/200704041/) which potentially exposed all the payroll data for 46,000 employees‚Äîmyself among them.

I have a few longer posts simmering at the moment, but for now here’s a few links of interest:

[Violence linked to price of beer](https://www.mindhacks.com/blog/2007/04/violence_linked_to_p.html)- [YouTube – Debunking myths about the “Third World”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUwS1uAdUcI) – From the TED talks. The animated visualizations are incredible and informative! Tufte would be proud.
- [Yahoo Pipes: Rewire the web](https://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/) – interesting user-friendly internet mashup tech from Yahoo of all places
- [Google Launches Free 411 Service](https://www.techcrunch.com/2007/04/06/google-launches-free-411-business/)
- The [20th edition](https://scienceblogs.com/neurontic/2007/04/encephalon_20.php) of *Encephalon* has just been published.
- [Amazing Filtered Things: Creating pictures on a few layers of glass](https://amazingfiltered.blogspot.com/2007/04/guy-create-pictures-on-few-layers-of.html)

Also I’ve been using Google Reader lately, and I added on my sidebar a dynamic feed the recent postings I find interesting. A more complete list can be read on my public Google Reader [Shared Items](https://www.google.com/reader/shared/00170192886383847618) page.
